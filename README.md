# gonew
**A simple cli utility program that creates Go projects for you.**

No more ``mkdir foo && cd foo && touch main.go`` nonsense. Just put the binary somewhere on your path and call ``gonew`` plus an optional argument of the project name and it does it all for you! 

Also made it in Haskell cause why not :)
